My first meeting with the GSoC mentors was on Saturday 18th May, 2019 scheduled
between 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM (IST). Me, Amit and Yathartha were the attendees of
the meeting. As per the community bonding period the first meeting was meant to
increase the familiarity between me and my mentors and we also discussed about
completing lambert solver. Major points discussed in the meeting are:-

 - Schedule and frequency of meetings.

 - How to proceed with completing lambert, understanding existing code and
 writing tests for it.


As of now I have looked few things:

 - How `lambert` works in `bivariate`.

 - How equations are converted to target equation.

 - Filtering out the tests to include all solutions.

 - What will be the flow to fix this problem.

In the previous days I have been understanding the flow of `bivariate` along with
`solve` and `solveset`. It might take time for me to go through it and arrive
at a good plan but I am trying to learn the art of general aspects of a open
source software. I believe in understanding rather than rushing. The mentors were
very kind and helpfull.

Hope things go as planned!!
