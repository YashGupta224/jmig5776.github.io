This was the first week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Sunday 2nd June, 2019 between 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM (IST). Me, Amit and Yathartha
were the attendees of the meeting. In this meeting we mainly discussed about the
problems and implementation for my pull request [#16890](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16890)
to complete the lambert solver.\\
As Amit requested changes at the pull request to describe the problem in detail,
to give proof of correctness and describe the plan more briefly. So here below
are the all details for what I am trying to achieve and how I am trying to
achieve this:-

### What problem is faced by lambert/bivariate currently?

Let me show here code from `_lambert` function to show the current
implementation so that I could describe the problem in detail:-
```python
u = Dummy('rhs')
sol = []
# check only real solutions:
for k in [-1, 0]:
    l = LambertW(d/(a*b)*exp(c*d/a/b)*exp(-f/a), k)
    # if W's arg is between -1/e and 0 there is
    # a -1 branch real solution, too.
    if k and not l.is_real:
        continue
    rhs = -c/b + (a/d)*l

    solns = solve(X1 - u, x)
    for i, tmp in enumerate(solns):
        solns[i] = tmp.subs(u, rhs)
        sol.append(solns[i])
return sol
```

Explanation of for loop:

1. `k == -1` :- In this case all the real solutions are considered due to `not l.is_real`.
2. `k == 0` :- In this case all the solutions come out to be real as always.

Now the problem that it is facing to return all solutions :

- The problem is with the argument inside the `LambertW` function of value
```
l = LambertW(d/(a*b)*exp(c*d/a/b)*exp(-f/a), k)
```
While converting all lambert solvable equations to this form
`F(X, a..f) = a*log(b*X + c) + d*X + f = 0` some solutions get missed.

For eg:

![](/public/week1-img2.jpeg)
![](/public/week1-img3.jpeg)
![](/public/week1-img4.jpeg)
![](/public/week1-img5.jpeg)

I think I had explained most of the things above which were required.
