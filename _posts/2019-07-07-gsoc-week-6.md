This was the sixth week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Sunday 7th July, 2019 between 1:45 - 2:45 PM (IST). Me, Yathartha and Amit
were the attendees of the meeting. This meeting was short.

- Discussing previous week's progress

In this meeting both the mentors were convinced by the code for Lambert's.
And few modifications in documentation and code clean up were suggested by them.
In this week the whole idea of power_list was droppped because @smichr suggested
code for replacing the symbol more targetted as we wanted by which the whole code
was improved. And it was decided to work upon on `_solve_modular` mainly now
onwards.


- Next week goals

* Getting merge existing PR for Lambert

* Work upon `_solve_modular` PR

* If time left then find plan for Imageset Union.

Code improvement takes time!!
