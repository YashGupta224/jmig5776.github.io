This was the fourth week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Sunday 22th June, 2019 between 12:30 - 01:30 PM (IST). Me and Yathartha
were the attendees of the meeting.

- Discussing previous week's progress

In the previous week many things happened very suddenly. In the starting of the
week it was decided that we had to create a function `power_list` which could
return powers. So I thought to create this type of function as a new feature in
this PR [#17043](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17043).
But as @jksoum and @smichr advised that this function can act as
helper function in `bivariate` itself so it was decided to make it as helper
function there. And we discussed the code for handling modular equations also.

- Next week goals

* Implementing and get plan for defining imageset union

As per the timeline we decided that Imageset Union should be defined first rather
than code for handling nested trigonometric equation solver. So according to
timeline this week goes for discussion and getting plan for implementing imageset
union. A PR [#17079](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17079) is also started
based on fundamental approach to solve the problem.

* Getting merge Lambert Solver

Most of the work had been done only a little improvement is to be done in `power_list`
function. Hope it gets merged by this week.

Code improvement takes time!!
