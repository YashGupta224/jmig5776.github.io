This was the eleventh week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Sunday 11th August, 2019 between 11:30 - 12:30 PM (IST). Me, Yathartha and Amit
were the attendees of the meeting. `_solve_modular` was discussed in this meeting.

Here is all the brief description about new solver `_solve_modular` for solving
modular equations.
### What type of equations to be considered and what domain?
```
A - Mod(B, C) = 0

    A -> This can or cannot be a function specifically(Linear, nth degree single
         Pow, a**f_x and Add and Mul) of symbol.(But currently its not a
        function of x)
    B -> This is surely a function of symbol.
    C -> It is an integer.
And domain should be a subset of S.Integers.
```
### Filtering out equations
A check is being applied named `_is_modular` which verifies that only above
mentioned type equation should return True.

### Working of `_solve_modular`
In the starting of it there is a check if domain is a subset of Integers.
```
domain.is_subset(S.Integers)
```
Only domain of integers and it subset are being considered while solving
these equations.
Now after this it separates out a modterm and the rest term on either
sides by this code.
```
modterm = list(f.atoms(Mod))[0]
rhs = -(S.One)*(f.subs(modterm, S.Zero))
if f.as_coefficients_dict()[modterm].is_negative:
    # f.as_coefficient(modterm) was returning None don't know why
    # checks if coefficient of modterm is negative in main equation.
    rhs *= -(S.One)
```
Now the equation is being inverted with the helper routine `_invert_modular`
like this.
```
n = Dummy('n', integer=True)
f_x, g_n = _invert_modular(modterm, rhs, n, symbol)
```
I am defining n in `_solve_modular` because `_invert_modular` contains
recursive calls to itself so if define the n there then it was going to have
many instances which of no use. Thats y I am defining it in `_solve_modular`.

Now after the equation is inverted now solution finding takes place.
```
if f_x is modterm and g_n is rhs:
        return unsolved_result
```
First of all if `_invert_modular` fails to invert then a ConditionSet is being
returned.
```
    if f_x is symbol:
        if domain is not S.Integers:
            return domain.intersect(g_n)
        return g_n
```
And if `_invert_modular` is fully able to invert the equation then only domain
intersection needs to takes place. `_invert_modular` inverts the equation
considering S.Integers as its default domain.

```
    if isinstance(g_n, ImageSet):
        lamda_expr = g_n.lamda.expr
        lamda_vars = g_n.lamda.variables
        base_set = g_n.base_set
        sol_set = _solveset(f_x - lamda_expr, symbol, S.Integers)
        if isinstance(sol_set, FiniteSet):
            tmp_sol = EmptySet()
            for sol in sol_set:
                tmp_sol += ImageSet(Lambda(lamda_vars, sol), base_set)
            sol_set = tmp_sol
        return domain.intersect(sol_set)
```
In this case when g_n is an ImageSet of n and f_x is not symbol so the
equation is being solved by calling `_solveset` (this will not lead to
recursion because equation to be entered is free from Mod) and then
the domain intersection takes place.

### What does `_invert_modular` do?
This function helps to convert the equation `A - Mod(B, C) = 0` to a
form (f_x, g_n).
First of all it checks the possible instances of invertible cases if not then
it returns the equation as it is.
```
a, m = modterm.args
if not isinstance(a, (Dummy, Symbol, Add, Mul, Pow)):
        return modterm, rhs
```
Now here is the check for complex arguments and returns the equation as it is
if somewhere it finds I.
```
if rhs.is_real is False or any(term.is_real is False \
            for term in list(_term_factors(a))):
        # Check for complex arguments
        return modterm, rhs
```
Now after this we check of emptyset as a solution by checking range of both
sides of equation.
As modterm can have values between [0, m - 1] and if rhs is out of this range
then emptySet is being returned.
```
if (abs(rhs) - abs(m)).is_positive or (abs(rhs) - abs(m)) is S.Zero:
        # if rhs has value greater than value of m.
        return symbol, EmptySet()
```
Now the equation haveing these types are being returned as the following
```
if a is symbol:
        return symbol, ImageSet(Lambda(n, m*n + rhs), S.Integers)

    if a.is_Add:
        # g + h = a
        g, h = a.as_independent(symbol)
        if g is not S.Zero:
            return _invert_modular(Mod(h, m), (rhs - Mod(g, m)) % m, n, symbol)

    if a.is_Mul:
        # g*h = a
        g, h = a.as_independent(symbol)
        if g is not S.One:
            return _invert_modular(Mod(h, m), (rhs*invert(g, m)) % m, n, symbol)
```
The more peculiar case is of `a.is_Pow` which is handled as following.
```
if a.is_Pow:
        # base**expo = a
        base, expo = a.args
        if expo.has(symbol) and not base.has(symbol):
            # remainder -> solution independent of n of equation.
            # m, rhs are made coprime by dividing igcd(m, rhs)
            try:
                remainder = discrete_log(m / igcd(m, rhs), rhs, a.base)
            except ValueError: # log does not exist
                return modterm, rhs
            # period -> coefficient of n in the solution and also referred as
            # the least period of expo in which it is repeats itself.
            # (a**(totient(m)) - 1) divides m. Here is link of theoram:
            # (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_theorem)
            period = totient(m)
            for p in divisors(period):
                # there might a lesser period exist than totient(m).
                if pow(a.base, p, m / igcd(m, a.base)) == 1:
                    period = p
                    break
            return expo, ImageSet(Lambda(n, period*n + remainder), S.Naturals0)
        elif base.has(symbol) and not expo.has(symbol):
            remainder_list = nthroot_mod(rhs, expo, m, all_roots=True)
            if remainder_list is None:
                return symbol, EmptySet()
            g_n = EmptySet()
            for rem in remainder_list:
                g_n += ImageSet(Lambda(n, m*n + rem), S.Integers)
            return base, g_n
```
Two cases are being created based of a.is_Pow
1. x**a
2. a**x

x**a -  It is being handled by the helper function `nthroot_mod` which returns
        required solution. I am not going into very mch detail for more
        information you can read the documentation of nthroot_mod.

a**x - For this `totient` is being used in the picture whose meaning can be
       find on this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_theorem)
       page. And then its divisors are being checked to find the least period
       of solutions.

Hope I am able to clear out everything!!


Code improvement takes time!!
