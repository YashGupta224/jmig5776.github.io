This was the eigth week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Saturday 27th July, 2019 between 1:30 - 2:30 PM (IST). Me, Yathartha and Amit
were the attendees of the meeting.

- Discussing previous week's progress

1. Progress of `_solve_modular`:- In PR [#16976](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16976)
I implemented the basic design of `_solve_modular`. Some very good suggestion by
Yathartha for creating `_invert_modular` were very helpful. Now basically the
`_solve_modular` first do preprocessing and invert it and then find solution and
in final domain intersection takes place.

2. Progress of ImageSet Union:- In PR [#17079](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17079)
I will be implementing an algorithm based on heurestics for performing ImageSet
Union this week. Basic code is being already written for defining a function and
only algorithm part is left which will be performed in this week.

- Next week goals

* Work upon `_solve_modular` and ImageSet Union PR

Code improvement takes time!!
