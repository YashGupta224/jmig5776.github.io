This was the eigth week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Saturday 20th July, 2019 between 12:30 - 1:30 PM (IST). Me, Yathartha and Amit
were the attendees of the meeting.
Finally the PR [#16890](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16890) is merged to
Sympy master and the work for Lambert has been completed. It was only possible
because of the mentors and especially @smichr for his great suggestions in code.

- Discussing previous week's progress

In this meeting the goals for the time left for GSoC were decided as follows:-

1. Lambert:- Completed and merged.

2. Solve modular:-
What I experienced with lambert's PR that got stretched so much which I was not
expecting. Algorithms made from heuristics takes so much time to be ready for
merging so I really don't know how much time it will take. But It is sure that
it will be completed before the final evaluation.

3. ImageSet Union:- This task will be taken after the solve modular. This is a
very complex task and will need proper guidance and algorithm. I had searched
for some research papers, but what I found out was not that what we want.
Before GSoC final evaluation this task will be started to implement, but I am
not really sure if it would get merged before final evaluation.


- Next week goals

* Work upon `_solve_modular` PR

* If time left then find plan for Imageset Union.

Code improvement takes time!!
