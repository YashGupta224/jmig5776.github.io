This was the third week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Sunday 16th June, 2019 between 12:00 - 01:00 PM (IST). Me, Amit, Yathartha and
Shekhar were the attendees of the meeting. In this meeting mainly it was discussed
to improve the code quality and make routine of independent working code.

- Code quality

Every programmer should master this skill to write a good quality code. Everything from
naming, documentation to make routines includes in this skill.

And we discussed mainly the code for the PR [#16890](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16890)
and realising that a new function `power_list` to be made to return all the
powers of symbols present in an expression.

Learning new skills!!
