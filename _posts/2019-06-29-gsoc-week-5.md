This was the fifth week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Saturday 29th June, 2019 between 11:30 - 12:30 PM (IST). Me, Yathartha and Amit
were the attendees of the meeting. I passed my first evaluation, Amit gave his
feedback and told me some very important points to take notes on. I do personally
believe that his suggestions are the best a mentor could gave to his student after
practicing his suggestions in my real life.

- Discussing previous week's progress

In this meeting both mentors suggested me to work upon the code improvements and
documentation improvement. And make it more readable to user. ALthough somehow
@smichr had some doubts on the logic that we were implementing. Although a lot
of progress has been there. So I decided to create and discussion for thinking
new logic for implementing Lambert all solutions and work on the current PR as
goes on.

- Next week goals

* Improving existing PR for Lambert

* Improving `_solve_modular` PR also

* If time left then find plan for Imageset Union.

Code improvement takes time!!
