This was the tenth week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Sunday 4th August, 2019 between 1:00 - 2:00 PM (IST). Me, Yathartha
were the attendees of the meeting.

- Discussing previous week's progress

1. Progress of `_solve_modular`:- In PR [#16976](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16976)
After discussing with Yathartha, I decided to change the basic model of the `_solve_modular `
such that I should be able to target equations more efficiently and also the rest
of the types of equation should return ConditionSet. Cases like `Mod(a**x, m) - rhs = 0`
are special type and will be handled differently with the helper functions of ntheory module.

2. Progress of ImageSet Union:- In PR [#17079](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17079)
This PR is currently been left for review.

- Next week goals

* Work upon `_solve_modular`
- In the following week I will be changing the domain of solving equations to
Integers only.


Code improvement takes time!!
